        <p>"I've been a professional photographer for 35 years and in that time I've travelled to many countries through all seven continents. I often find myself wanting to reminisce and for a long time I've had an aversion to it because my studio was piled high with memory cards and film rolls. When I discovered Expat Journal it really changed my life for the better with its easy to use platform and it's given me an opportunity to share a lifetime of adventures with my grandchildren." <br> <br>  - Griffith Realman, AUS</p>
